                      .caption There are numerous reasons people go to the gym. If you're looking for a gym that is going to inspire you to be better this is where the magic happens; strength, endurance, mobility, and personal touch. I have participated in different fitness routines over the last 12 years. I was an all state powerlifter, half marathon runner, Crossfit athlete, and participated in Roller Derby.Â Strength is not built overnight, the studio has allowed me to become better. My back and core were out of commission prior to EnergyX. In the four short months I have been at the studio I have strengthen my entire body & lost 23 pounds, INJURY FREE! Endurance, prior to joining the studio I could barely run a mile (after training for numerous half marathons the last thing I wanted to do was run again). EnergyX helped me regain my endurance through rowing and my stamina is back to an all time high, who would have thought endurance building could be so fun! Mobility, I took for granted how important my mobility was prior to joining the studio. I can now balance (through all sorts of fun flexible yoga moves), I now look forward to yoga (which I dreaded in the past), and it has made me a more well rounded athlete. EnergyX may be the only Rowing studio in San Antonio but that's not why I go there.Personal touch; when I look for a gym, a box, or a studio I need to feel comfortable and most importantly wanted. The way these trainers truly care and take the time to get to know you is like no other.Â  What they are doing in this studio is magical and getting to feel like a part of that makes you feel powerful. This studio isn't worth checking out, it's worth becoming a part of.

                      .caption I have been attending classes at EnergyX Fitness since its opening. What attracted me initially was the convenience of walking to the studio that is very near my home. What has kept me coming back is a team of experienced, professional instructors that work to ensure each client achieves his or her fitness goals. Alison, for example, through private physical training, helped me recover from an unrelated back injury, and she continues to encourage and push me to new levels. I appreciate the variety of class offerings that incorporate rowing, strength training and even yoga for a customized, comprehensive workout.

Whether you're trying to beat your own time on the rower or squatting with sandbags, you need great people cheering you on.

We have grown to love coming to Energy-X 3-4 times a week because there is so much variety in the classes. Weâ€™ve both lost weight and increased our muscle tone, but our biggest takeaway is finding a positive community of people who have helped us like working out!

As a runner, I love rowing as a cross training activity because it works my whole body and and cardio system. These workouts are great for improving core strength, posture, and high heart-rate stamina. Most importantly, the balance exercises have really helped me stay injury-free. I wouldn't be achieving my fitness goals without them!

I have delicate knees so the low-impact IndoRow classes are perfect for me. I stay off my knees and still get a really intense, full-body, cardio workout. You will get sweaty; you will have fun! The instructors each bring something different to the courses and are always looking out for rowing form and finding ways to challenge you
