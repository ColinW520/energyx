# Collect

## Resident

### Challenge

I can't always make it to the office before it closes at 5:00. I'd love to pay online; but, their service doesn't work on my phone, and the fees for same-day debit card payments are just so high! 

### Solution

The community I live at uses Aptexx Collect. Now, I get a reminder text message every month, and pay right from my phone. My payment posts the same day I make it, and I can use my debit card for only $4.95. It's so easy!
